# Bildung Blox

> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) Version 7.2.2 and uses both [Blox](https://blox.src.zone/material/guides/gettingstarted) and [Angular MDC](https://github.com/trimox/angular-mdc-web) where we can get away with it.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Development Notes

> Configure various navigation options, then theme the color swatches and  typography &mdash; we like [News Cycle](https://fonts.google.com/?query=news+cycle) &mdash; then rehearse layouts and components. In other words an all but the kitchen sinker.
